I don't know why it's so hard to find but whenever I want to look at my automated investments on Charles Schwab, it is so dang hard to find. I always end up digging through a random Reddit thread to find the answer.

Here's how you do it:

1. login to schwab
2. go to https://client.schwab.com/app/trade/aip/#/home
3. select an account eligible for mutal funds investing
4. fill out the form and enroll!

Woot woot! That's it!

Earlier this year, I started two newsletters: one about [learning Argentinian Spanish](https://speakargentinianspanish.com/) and another about [helping non-native English speakers land remote dev jobs](https://englishbyte.com/). Because of the heavy focus on Newsletters as a medium, I gathered a lot of notes. Fair warning though...one newsletter has 80+ subs and the other has 1000+ so take my notes with a grain of salt.

But they've been living in my Notion...which means they're not available to anyone but me. I decided, "Why let these sit here and rot? Let's publish on my blog, clear up Notion and maybe it'll help someone else."

Plus, I'm selfishly hoping it starts a conversation with someone new and leads to a new friendship. That's the whole point of putting your thoughts on the internet anyway.

So let's dive in. 

### Newsletters about Newsletters

Anyone talking about newsletters or how to grow them, I instantly subscribed to. That lead to a lot of inbox fatigue. But, these all still have valuable tips, many around newsletter growth and monetization.

Here's the short list along with a short description of each:
- [The Saturday Solopreneur by Justin Welsh](https://www.justinwelsh.me/) with tips, strategies, and resources to launch, grow, and monetize your internet business."
- [The Newsletter Nerd by Jay Yang](https://newsletternerd.beehiiv.com/) with practical tips for growing your newsletter
- [Growth in Reverse](https://growthinreverse.com/) One of my favorites! "Each week, I reverse engineer how a top creator grew from 0 to 50k+ subscribers."
- [Newsletter Operator](https://www.newsletteroperator.com/) where you learn "How to grow and monetize your newsletter. Learn the exact tactics top newsletters are using"

### How to Make $1M with a Newsletter Business

Again, planning to go all in on newsletters and make a bet I could figure out how to pass my full-time income, I created a roadmap for getting to one million in revenue. Enjoy!

The math for a $1m newsletter is simple. All you need to do is get 2% of 100,000 subscribers to convert on purchasing a $250 course. And you need to send 2 newsletters per week, with 1 ad spot per newsletter and sell each spot for $5,000 for a total of 104 ad spots per year. Simple? Yes. Easy? No. 

**Summary**

- 100,000 subscribers
- 2% conversion rate
- $250 course
- 2 newsletters/week
- 1 ad spot per newsletter
- $5,000 per ad spot

**Course Revenue**

- 100,000 x 2% = 1,000 conversions
- 2,000 x $250 = $500,000 revenue

**Ad Revenue**

- 52 weeks/year * 2 newsletters/week = 104 ad spots
- 104 x $5,000 = $520,000 revenue

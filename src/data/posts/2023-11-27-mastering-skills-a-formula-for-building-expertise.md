Can you actually become the top 1% of programmers from just reading the docs?

That might get you to into [the 95%](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) as a programmer due to lower standards these days, but I don’t think that’s enough. Reading and understanding the docs is only part of the picture. 



Besides…you know what I want? A formula. One that can be applied to *any skill*, not only programming.

## Background

The other day, I was talking to a coworker about microphones. “Yeah, I’ve had this one for a while but I don’t *love* it.” 



> “Dude, you should get the setup I have. I knew this guy from college who had a podcast and was an audio engineer. I said to him, ‘I’ll pay you $100 to hop on a call and help me get the best setup for podcasting.” 



So I reached out to his friend — [Sage Goodwin](https://twitter.com/UplinkPodcast) — and asked if he still recommended the same setup and the answer was yes. So I ordered it a couple weeks later.

After [sharing on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsjoeio/status/1645517102193987585?s=20), a couple friends suggested getting a preamp which gives you a bit of a boost (helpful if your mic is sounding quiet). I got [this one](https://www.amazon.com/TRITON-AUDIO-FetHead-Microphone-Preamp/dp/B06XDPTDN5/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=fethead&sr=8-2). 


## The Problem

I still felt like my mic was quiet. And to be fair, I had this problem with [my previous mic setup](https://howtoegghead.com/instructor/screencasting/audio-equipment/). 

It felt like most audio playback (Spotify, YouTube, etc) could be played at 5/10 of the system volume. But for whatever reason, when I played back videos recorded using my mic, I had to adjust the volume to 8/10.

And who wants to adjust the mic every time they switch between content? Nobody.

Finally, my friend Brent responded to my tweet with a suggestion that covered everything. 


## The Solution

This 4-min video. This explains the exact problem I was having and explains how to solve it in OBS using a combination of filters. It’s a must-watch if you’re facing this problem.

"Can I take Spanish 1-2 instead of Spanish 3-4?" I asked my mom before freshman year of high school. All my friends were downleveling, but she wisely said no.

Fast-forward 15 years to 2023. Now, my two-year-old daughter is bilingual, speaking both Spanish and English. The high school me couldn't have predicted Spanish becoming such a significant part of my life.

This piece reflects on my journey as a non-native Spanish speaker, raising our daughter to be bilingual over the past 730 days.



### "Why choose to raise your daughter bilingual in Spanish?"

My love for Spanish began in high school. It felt like a portal to another world. I studied it throughout high school, college, and spent a semester in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Three months before our daughter's birth, my wife and I asked ourselves, "Why not raise her bilingual?"

I envied those who grew up bilingual, thanks to their parents. So, we decided to give it a shot, a lifelong gift for our daughter. I'd read stories of non-native speakers succeeding in raising bilingual kids, including my high school Spanish teacher. I felt confident in my abilities to make it happen.



### "How proficient are you in Spanish?"

I began at 13 and now, at 29, I have come a long way. Videos document my progress from college ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNYiEhIhC78), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWeH9KaMy3o)) and our bilingual journey's inception ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUnfzHI0KV8), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEZTVsru6U)) , including a [recent podcast episode](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/joe-previte-ingeniero-de-software-autodidacta-apasionado-de-la-linguistica-y-de-ayudar-a-otros-a-aprender/) from a month ago. So, you can see how much I've grown throughout this journey with my daughter.



### "What's her daily language learning routine, switching between Spanish with you and English with your wife?"

We follow the [One Parent, One Language (OPOL)](https://smartparentingpod.com/one-parent-one-language-opol-method-is-it-effective-for-bilingualism/) approach: my wife speaks English, and I speak Spanish. However, my wife occasionally uses basic Spanish. For example, we call milk "*leche*."

I exclusively speak Spanish to her, except for rare exceptions like public outings. With my full-time job and my wife caring for her, she gets Spanish input from me before work, at lunch, after work, and on weekends—approximately 4 hours on weekdays and 10 hours on weekends, totaling around 24 hours per week.



### "What's your family's stance on your daughter learning Spanish?"

Everyone is supportive. Even her grandparents use Spanish occasionally. Our daughter often calls her water bottle "*agua*," and others follow suit. My wife uses short Spanish sentences like "*quieres huevos*." It's been a positive experience.



### "Teaching 'neutral Spanish' or a specific dialect?"

My belief is that learners should focus on a specific dialect, as "neutral Spanish" exists primarily in academics. After my semester in Argentina, I adopted [Rioplatense Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rioplatense_Spanish) due to my love for the people and culture. That's the dialect I use with my daughter.

I even started a [newsletter on Argentinian Spanish](https://speakargentinianspanish.com/) to share resources for her learning and to improve my fluency.



### "Maintaining her Spanish as she enters school in the community language?"

In Arizona, we have options for immersion or bilingual preschools, as the state has many Spanish speakers, mainly from Mexico. We haven't decided yet, but we're looking for community groups to provide extra exposure. There's a [bilingual playgroup in Chandler](https://bilinguitos.com/grupoplay/), and we're hoping to find or start one in Scottsdale.



### "Challenges in this bilingual journey and staying on track with your language goals?"

Over the past two years, I've encountered several challenges. One major hurdle is a limited vocabulary, despite being fluent. I often forget or never learned specific words. For example, "potty" is *[pelela](https://www.diccionarioargentino.com/term/Pelela)*. A friend suggested writing down unknown words and using English in the moment, which helps.

Impostor syndrome speaking Spanish in public used to bother me, but it usually leads to fascinating conversations with native speakers. Many people ask if I'm from Spain (guessing it's based on my looks and the weird accent). Overall, I've received positive responses and now feel more confident.

My primary goal is to persist in speaking Spanish, even on challenging days with little sleep or a foggy brain.



### "Materials and methods for teaching Spanish?"

While I've considered formal curricula like [Mama Llama Linguist](https://mamallamalinguist.com/), for now, it's about integrating Spanish into everyday life. We watch [Blippi en español](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YImPQT-_0kCh5joATwyhw) and [Spanish with Liz](https://www.youtube.com/@SpanishwithLiz) on the TV or iPad.

I play Argentinian radio stations using [Tune In](https://tunein.com/) and refer to [SpanishDict](https://spanishdict.com/), [WordReference](https://www.wordreference.com/), or [Diccionario Argentino](https://www.diccionarioargentino.com/) for word lookup. I've drawn inspiration from [Refold's language learning philosophy](https://refold.la/simplified).

I also try to consume Spanish content daily or weekly.



### "Does she express her needs in Spanish or English?"

Her speaking has flourished lately. She adjusts her language depending on the audience. With me, she says "*comer*" when hungry or "*agua*" when thirsty. She's learning to differentiate between the languages. Sometimes, she'll come up to me and say something in English like "help me," but a gentle "*en español*" reminds her to use Spanish.



### "Any changes in your approach since you began?"

I realized I needed to adapt when telling her what to say to kids who don't speak Spanish. For instance, suggesting "*decíle no thank you*" instead of "*decíle no gracias*" is more effective because when she says it, she's speaking to an English speaker (like her cousin). I also wish I'd started reading Spanish books with her earlier. But now we go to the library almost once a week and checkout children's books in Spanish.

"Your feelings about raising a non-Hispanic, non-Argentinian daughter bilingual?"

I feel like an "outsider" at times, raising her as a non-Hispanic with Argentinian Spanish. She'll never be Hispanic or Argentinian, but she will be a Spanish speaker, which makes for a unique identity. We plan to expose her to Hispanic culture through food, media, and travel to Spanish-speaking countries.

It'll be fascinating getting her perspective on this as she grows older.



### "Videos of your daughter speaking Spanish?"

I don't have any public videos to share but here is an audio recording from a video I recorded today when I was feeding her lunch.

## Summary

This journey has been incredible. Sharing the gift of language with my daughter, though challenging, is immensely rewarding. As she starts talking more, maintaining her Spanish will be tough, but I'm committed to it and have no plans of giving up.

The key challenges I'll face in the foreseeable future: 

* Expanding my vocabulary for her benefit
* Seeking community in Scottsdale
* Providing additional input and exposure through schooling

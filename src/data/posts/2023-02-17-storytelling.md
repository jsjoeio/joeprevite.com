S﻿torytelling is an art. I think someone who can code *and* tell good stories is unstoppable. It's one thing to build a cool product. It's another to tell the story that convinces people to listen and try it.

I started paying attention to this skill in 2022 and working with a coach to get better.

H﻿ere is what I've learned so far:

## Framework for Critical Arcs

M﻿y coach and friend [Roger](https://twitter.com/rogertippingII) helped me breakdown the framework:

1. setup

   * add some foreshadowing
2. make interactions with person interesting

   * need something to be interesting before we find out he is a millionaire 
   * connect with person first
3. reveal

   * success
   * “now what can i learn from this?”
4. transition from obvious → less obvious ephiphany

   * what i learned about \[insert topic]
   * the real lesson about life
5. transition from what i learned → what audience can learn

   * “let them share your epiphany” 
   * how can they apply it themselves
   * connect to them 
   * this is the meta (break fourth wall)

## Summary from Julian's Tweet Thread

[J﻿ulian](https://twitter.com/Julian) wrote a wonderful thread on storytelling [here](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1563588259942264832). This is my summary:

The **Art of Storytelling** is to:

* strategically withhold information
* drag out the nail-biting details
* use vocal rhythm *or* blow your own mind

Breaking it into individual, you need to be able to:

1. identify stories worth-telling:

   * moments that are either formative or painful
   * moments of triumph or cringe 
2. be charismatic

   * charisma = confidence + joy + love
3. practice public solitude 

   * speak as if you’re alone in the room
   * research Konstantin Stanislavski
4. blow your own mind

   * relive feelings before speaking
   * see Jason Silva as an example

## Summary from Sam Parr's Talk

S﻿am gave a great [20-min talk at some conference](https://youtu.be/TqTl_FS3hf0?t=110). Here are my notes:

* Start with **Distribution**

  * Who do I want to reach and where are they?
  * What medium are they going to be coming from?

    * Search, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
* Figure out **The Headline**
* Finally, *What’s the Story?*

  * What’s the emotion I want them to feel?
* Example: guy from Missouri doing millions with a newsletter

  * * Blew his mind → Emotion = shock
    * Story = this guy and his son doing millions with newsletter
    * Figure out headline
    * Figure out where this will be popular

I﻿ hope to update this as I learn more!

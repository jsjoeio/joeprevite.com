Storytelling is an art. I think someone who can code *and* tell good stories is unstoppable. It's one thing to build a cool product. It's another to tell the story that convinces people to listen and try it.

I started paying attention to this skill in 2022 and working with a coach to get better.

Here is what I've learned so far:

## Framework for Critical Arcs

My coach and friend [Roger](https://twitter.com/rogertippingII) helped me breakdown the framework:

### 1. Setup
- Add some foreshadowing.

### 2. Make interactions with the person interesting
- Need something to be interesting before we find out he is a millionaire.
- Connect with the person first.

### 3. Reveal
- Success.
- "Now what can I learn from this?"

### 4. Transition from obvious → less obvious epiphany
- What I learned about [insert topic].
- The real lesson about life.

### 5. Transition from what I learned → what the audience can learn
- "Let them share your epiphany."
- How can they apply it themselves?
- Connect to them.
- This is the meta (break the fourth wall).

## Summary from Julian's Tweet Thread

[Julian](https://twitter.com/Julian) wrote a wonderful thread on storytelling [here](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1563588259942264832). This is my summary:

The **Art of Storytelling** is to:

- Strategically withhold information.
- Drag out the nail-biting details.
- Use vocal rhythm *or* blow your own mind.

Breaking it into individual steps, you need to be able to:

### 1. Identify stories worth telling:
- Moments that are either formative or painful.
- Moments of triumph or cringe.

### 2. Be charismatic:
- Charisma = confidence + joy + love.

### 3. Practice public solitude:
- Speak as if you’re alone in the room.
- Research Konstantin Stanislavski.

### 4. Blow your own mind:
- Relive feelings before speaking.
- See Jason Silva as an example.

## Summary from Sam Parr's Talk

Sam gave a great [20-min talk at some conference](https://youtu.be/TqTl_FS3hf0?t=110). Here are my notes:

- Start with **Distribution**:
  - Who do I want to reach and where are they?
  - What medium are they going to be coming from?
    - Search, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
- Figure out **The Headline**.
- Finally, *What’s the Story?*:
  - What’s the emotion I want them to feel?

Example: A guy from Missouri doing millions with a newsletter.
- Blew his mind → Emotion = shock.
- Story = this guy and his son doing millions with a newsletter.
- Figure out the headline.
- Figure out where this will be popular.

I hope to update this as I learn more!

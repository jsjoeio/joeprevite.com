F﻿or a while, I've been on mission to find Argentinians and Argentine culture here in Arizona. At least, I've found something worth sharing.

#﻿# Argentinos en Arizona Facebook Group

I﻿ don't know why I didn't think about searching for this before but there is a large private Facebook group called [ARGENTINOS en ARIZONA](https://www.facebook.com/groups/103538341383/). I will have to report back on what I find in here.

M﻿y hope is to at least meet a couple parents here who have kids under 2. Maybe set up a little playdate so my daughter can get some Spanish practice in and I can meet some cool people.

#﻿# Buenos Aires Empanadas

T﻿here is a family that sells authentic empanadas at farmer's markets, catering, etc. Here is a link to the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/laequinaargentina/).

#﻿# Che Empanada Cafe

T﻿his is a restaurant in Tucson which also has Argentinian food. You can find there site [here](https://checafeusa.com/).

#﻿# Dellepiane

T﻿his is a restaurant in Sedona which makes really good burgers apparently. More info [here](https://sedona.org/sedona-restaurants/dellepiane-sedona/).

I﻿'ll add more to this as I find it. Wish me luck!

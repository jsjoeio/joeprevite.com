I saw your [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lennyrachitsky_apply-to-be-a-lennys-newsletter-fellow-activity-7183595686351831040-RZnx) about the Newsletter Fellowship. I thought I'd put something together real quick for you to let me expand beyond the Google Form. 

### Writing, Podcast & Newsletter-y Things

- 13 years ago, I cold emailed a YC startup called [Verbling](https://www.verbling.com/) and got my first job in tech, doing QA. Before I knew how to code, I shared stories like [that one](https://jjprevite.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/from-a-cold-email-to-an-internship-in-the-heart-of-san-francisco/) on a WordPress blog.
- I taught myself how to code, then used writing to bootstrap my credibility by [writing for freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/jsjoeio/). That lead to getting involved with the JavaScript and web community [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsjoeio).
- I've been interviewed on a [handful of podcasts](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/77V3y3SJOmjNgxSA4jQOLJ?si=c5a034f300304d56).
- I've launched [multiple](https://vimforvscode.com/) [developer-education](https://www.typescriptcourse.com/) products.
- Last year, I ran two newsletters: [learning Argentinian Spanish](https://speakargentinianspanish.com/) and [English for programmers](https://englishbyte.com/).


### Engineering & Solopreneur-y Things
- I've worked at a handful of startups including [Verbling](https://www.verbling.com/), [Process Street](https://www.process.st/), [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/), [Coder](https://coder.com/) and [Bankless](https://www.bankless.com/). I also worked at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) on developer advocacy.
- In 2021, I made a total of [$36,942.02 from indiehacking](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/2021-income-report-36-942-02-4cff64da74) and shared the story of [launching my first product](https://joeprevite.com/launching-first-product).

### Why I Want To Do This

It comes down to three main reasons:
1. I want to learn from you
2. I want to give the newsletter/podast life a second shot
3. I want to explore the solopreneur path

I put together a [2.5min Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/96cc7304ab524305b40e79e780c8ae2f) if you want to hear more.

## Currently

I currently work as a Senior Full Stack Engineer in the Growth org at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/) where our team runs A/B experiments to increases key metrics such as the number of companies with deposits in their account by Day 30.

On the side, I'm actively exploring routes for solopreneur to supplement my full-time work, which is one of big reasons why I'm applying to the Newsletter Fellowship.
